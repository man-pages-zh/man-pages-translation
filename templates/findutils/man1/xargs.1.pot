"Here, the first invocation of B<xargs> has no input line length limit "
"because it doesn't use the B<-i> option.  The second invocation of B<xargs> "
"does have such a limit, but we have ensured that it never encounters a line "
"which is longer than it can handle.  This is not an ideal solution.  "
"Instead, the B<-i> option should not impose a line length limit, which is "
"why this discussion appears in the BUGS section.  The problem doesn't occur "
"with the output of B<find>(1)  because it emits just one filename per line."
