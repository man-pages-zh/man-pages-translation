"I<Zless> is a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text "
"files one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  It is the equivalent "
"of setting the environment variable LESSOPEN to '|gzip -cdfq -- %s', and the "
"environment variable LESSMETACHARS to "
"\\&'E<lt>spaceE<gt>E<lt>tabE<gt>E<lt>newlineE<gt>;*?\"()E<lt>E<gt>[|&^`#\\e$%=~', "
"and then running I<less>.  However, enough people seem to think that having "
"the command I<zless> available is important to be worth providing it."

"I<Zless> does not work with compressed data that is piped to it via standard "
"input; it requires that input files be specified as arguments.  To read "
"compressed data from a pipe, you can use .\\|.\\|.B<|gunzip|less> instead of "
".\\|.\\|.B<|zless>."
