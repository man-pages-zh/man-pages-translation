"Under Linux, there are GUIs (graphical user interfaces), where you can point "
"and click and drag, and hopefully get work done without first reading lots "
"of documentation.  The traditional UNIX environment is a CLI (command line "
"interface), where you type commands to tell the computer what to do.  That "
"is faster and more powerful, but requires finding out what the commands "
"are.  Below a bare minimum, to get started."
