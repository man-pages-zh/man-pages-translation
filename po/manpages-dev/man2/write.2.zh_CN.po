"Among the APIs subsequently listed are B<write>()  and B<writev>(2).  And "
"among the effects that should be atomic across threads (and processes)  are "
"updates of the file offset.  However, on Linux before version 3.14, this was "
"not the case: if two processes that share an open file description (see "
"B<open>(2))  perform a B<write>()  (or B<writev>(2))  at the same time, then "
"the I/O operations were not atomic with respect updating the file offset, "
"with the result that the blocks of data output by the two processes might "
"(incorrectly) overlap.  This problem was fixed in Linux 3.14."
