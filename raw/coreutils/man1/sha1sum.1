.SH NAME
sha1sum \- compute and check SHA1 message digest
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B sha1sum
[\fI\,OPTION\/\fR]... [\fI\,FILE\/\fR]...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" Add any additional description here
.PP
Print or check SHA1 (160\-bit) checksums.
.PP
With no FILE, or when FILE is \-, read standard input.
.TP
\fB\-b\fR, \fB\-\-binary\fR
read in binary mode
.TP
\fB\-c\fR, \fB\-\-check\fR
read checksums from the FILEs and check them
.TP
\fB\-\-tag\fR
create a BSD\-style checksum
.TP
\fB\-t\fR, \fB\-\-text\fR
read in text mode (default)
.TP
\fB\-z\fR, \fB\-\-zero\fR
end each output line with NUL, not newline,
and disable file name escaping
.SS "The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums:"
.TP
\fB\-\-ignore\-missing\fR
don't fail or report status for missing files
.TP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
don't print OK for each successfully verified file
.TP
\fB\-\-status\fR
don't output anything, status code shows success
.TP
\fB\-\-strict\fR
exit non\-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
.TP
\fB\-w\fR, \fB\-\-warn\fR
warn about improperly formatted checksum lines
.TP
\fB\-\-help\fR
display this help and exit
.TP
\fB\-\-version\fR
output version information and exit
.PP
The sums are computed as described in FIPS\-180\-1.
When checking, the input should be a former output of this program.
The default mode is to print a line with: checksum, a space,
a character indicating input mode ('*' for binary, ' ' for text
or where binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.
.PP
Note: There is no difference between binary mode and text mode on GNU systems.
.SH BUGS
Do not use the SHA-1 algorithm for security related purposes.
Instead, use an SHA\-2 algorithm, implemented in the programs
\fBsha224sum\fP(1), \fBsha256sum\fP(1), \fBsha384sum\fP(1), \fBsha512sum\fP(1),
or the BLAKE2 algorithm, implemented in \fBb2sum\fP(1)
