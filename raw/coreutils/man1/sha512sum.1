don't fail or report status for missing files
.TP
\fB\-\-quiet\fR
don't print OK for each successfully verified file
.TP
\fB\-\-status\fR
don't output anything, status code shows success
.TP
\fB\-\-strict\fR
exit non\-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines

The sums are computed as described in FIPS\-180\-2.
When checking, the input should be a former output of this program.
The default mode is to print a line with: checksum, a space,
a character indicating input mode ('*' for binary, ' ' for text
or where binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE.
.PP
Note: There is no difference between binary mode and text mode on GNU systems.
